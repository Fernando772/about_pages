Goal for the rest of this project is to work with all three technologies
to make your own website

The three primary web technologies are:
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

We will link the HTML pages together using <a>
We will style the pages using CSS .classes and #ids
We will make the pages interactive with javascript

HTML pages we will write ourselves
For CSS styles we will use a "library" called Bootstrap
For JS we will use a "library" called jQuery

---------------------------------------------------------

Project:

We will create four pages
- landing
- resume
- songs
- *whatever you want*

Monday Mar 21st
------------------------------------

1. Add Links to other pages

In home.html add links to header
  <a href='resume.html'>Resume</a>
  <a href='songs.html'>Songs</a>
  <a href='other.html'> *whatever you want*</a>

2.  Add HTML to other pages
  Copy over the HTML from 'home.html' to 'resume.html'
  Copy over the HTML from 'home.html' to 'songs.html'

  Create a new HTML page called *whatever you want*
  Copy over the HTML from 'home.html' to your new page

3. Add the "active" class to the links on the applicable pages

  See how the Home <li> has this class in home.html?
    <li class="active"><a href="#">Home</a></li>

  Add the "active" class to links on each page
